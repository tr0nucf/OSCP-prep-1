1. Do the buffer overflow first
A: enumerate more or google a way to enumerate the specific service differently
B: think of how what you enumerated > can you chain together to get a shell or sensitive information (service_xyz vuln + service_ttt vuln = the specfic exploit that works 
C: read the exploit you're using and see if it needs editing (based on target info)
3. I've seen alot of posts about how the exam machines are different than the lab, and from what I can tell they're different because you sometimes have to piece together more information. 
Many of the lab machines follow a simple formula of enumerate services --> searchsploit the service for vulns --> use the exploit to get a low priv shell --> privelege escalation shenanigans. 
However, in the exam machines it sometimes isn't as simple as just searchsploiting a potentially vulnerable service and then exploiting it.
4. Realize when your going down a rabbit hole.
5. Have a solid methodology for testing.

Offsec won't make you reinvent the wheel so to speak. In other words you won't need super complicated exploits to get root. The type of exploits that work on these machines will make you think "why didn't I think of that sooner?" But at the same time, the answer isn't right in your face.
